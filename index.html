      Hii Chhavi... kaisi hai<br />
      I hope your exams are going well and youâ€™re taking care of yourself
      <br /><br />
      After our last talk, I didnâ€™t reach out again not to disturb you, but
      to let you focus <br /><br />
      And now heard that your exams are almost done and will end on 15 May,
      I wanted to quietly leave this here <br /><br />
      Something Iâ€™ve madeâ€¦ with whatever was left in me<br />
     just to show what was always there <br /><br />
      (And yes, maybe Iâ€™m too stubborn when it comes to talking to you ðŸ˜…<br />
      So if you think this is too early, save it...<br />
      and watch it once youâ€™re free and relaxed ðŸŒ¸)<br />
      <br /> I just ask, if youâ€™re here reading this  please see it not with your
      eyes, but with your heart <br /><br />
      (please keep the sound onðŸ”Š Let the music also speak for me )
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden second-paragraph fade-in">
    Itâ€™s been almost three months now<br><br>
    And this flower you gave, still lives with me<br>
    Just like a piece of you stayed<br><br>

    I kept it safe, not because itâ€™s just a giftâ€¦<br>
    But because itâ€™s us<br>
    Two flowers, side by side, always connected<br><br>

    Maybe this is just my way of remembering<br>
    I kept them safe not just as a memory,<br>
    but as a quiet promise to myself<br>
    that when the time feels right,<br>
    Iâ€™ll let you see whatâ€™s been growing inside me since<br>

    Because some things donâ€™t fade,<br>
    they just wait.<br>


Iâ€™ve held on not out of stubbornness,
but out of belief<br><br>
Nowâ€¦ I want to show you something,
the one I never sentâ€¦ until today </p>
