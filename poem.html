    "You smiled like morning touched the skies,",
    "A world of stars hid in your eyes",
    "You spoke in glances, soft and few,",
    "But every word of yours rang true",
    "You walked like poems wore your name,",
    "Like even silence lit a flame",
    "You weren’t just someone passing through,",
    "The world turned softer next to you",
    "I saw the storm behind your grace,",
    "The hurt you hid behind your face",
    "Your silence louder than the rain,",
    "I felt the weight, I felt your pain",
    "I know I failed to understand,",
    "To hold your heart with steady hand",
    "I let the quiet build a wall,",
    "You reached for me, I missed the call",
    "But now I wear the truth like skin,",
    "And stitch the cracks I’ve held within",
    "If I could turn back time somehow,",
    "I’d choose to listen more than now",
    "I never asked you to forgive,",
    "But hoped you'd see the way I live",
    "Each day I walk a softer line,",
    "With folded hands, your peace and mine",
    "I’ve waited not with restless cries,",
    "But with the calm behind my eyes",
    "Not counting time, just letting be,",
    "And planting hope in memory",
    "Not every love burns wild and fast,",
    "Some bloom in silence, built to last",
    "And I have learned to wait and grow,",
    "Till you return, if hearts still know",
    "You gave me flowers, quiet, true,",
    "Not wrapped in words, but full of you.",
    "Two blooms that spoke in silent grace,",
    "Of warmth and storms we both would face",
    "I kept them close, like sacred light,",
    "Pressed in a book, still soft, still bright",
    "One was her - wild, free, and kind,",
    "The other me - still growing, blind",
    "I kept them safe through storm and sun,",
    "Their scent, your memory, always one",
    "And though they fade, they never die,",
    "Like promises we left in sky",
    "Side by side, they stood so still,",
    "Like hearts that bloomed against their will",
    "And even now, through wind and gloom,",
    "I dream of when they’ll dare re-bloom",
    "I don’t care how broken the pieces might be,",
    "If it's with you, it's still everything to me",
    "Cracks don’t scare me, nor do scars",
    "Even shattered hearts can still hold stars",
    "We don't need perfect, just a place to start,",
    "Two hands, one truth, and an open heart",
    "I’ve seen our worst and still believe,",
    "In all the love we’ve yet to weave",
    "Let them say it’s hard I know it’s true,",
    "But I’d walk through storms to stand by you",
    "You're not a page I’m willing to end",
    "You're a whole story I'd rewrite again",
    "So if there’s even a whisper left in you,",
    "Let it speak what your silence couldn’t do",
    "All I ask is a step, not the whole way",
    "I’ll meet you in the light, if you just don’t stray",
    "You held the pen once, now it’s yours again,",
    "To write the chapters where healing begins",
    "One word from you could open the sky,",
    "And I’d be there, no questions why",
    "I don’t ask for answers, not even a vow,",
    "Just a sign that there’s still a “somehow ”",
    "Even if silence turns you away,",
    "I’ll believe in us anyway",
    "I’m sorry for the times I stood too still,",
    "When silence grew heavy, against your will",
    "But I’ve changed the way I speak and stay,",
    "So you never feel alone that way",
    "If doubt still whispers, Will it break again?",
    "Know I’ve healed the hands that once caused pain",
    "If your mind still wonders, What if it breaks?",
    "Or fears the echoes of old mistakes",
    "Let me say this, with nothing to hide,",
    "I’ve changed the man who stood by your side",
    "No ego left, no battles to win,",
    "No doors that slam or silence within",
    "I carry no right, no claim, no tie",
    "Just a love that won’t make your soul cry",
    "I won’t beg, won’t bind, won’t pull you near,",
    "But you’ll never have to flinch from fear",
    "If we begin again, it won’t repeat",
    "I’ve buried the parts that brought you defeat",
    "This time, no shadows, no weight, no war",
    "Only a heart that won’t hurt yours anymore",
    "The way you felt lost in a crowded room,",
    "Now I’d hold your hand and give you room",
    "You won’t have to shrink, or dim your flame,",
    "I’d whisper your worth, not call your name",
    "You once gave flowers that spoke more than words,",
    "I’ve kept their scent, your voice still heard",
    "And in that quiet, I've grown to see,",
    "The kind of man I want to be",
    "I miss you more than these lines can show,",
    "In every breath, in every slow glow",
    "I miss you not with tears alone,",
    "But with the hope that love has grown",
    "I miss you in the spaces between breaths,",
    "Where the silence is loud, and my heart feels less",
    "I miss the weight of your hand in mine,",
    "A touch that once made everything align",
    "I miss the way your laughter filled the air,",
    "And how in your absence, all I have is despair",
    "I miss you like petals miss the rain,",
    "Like the sky holds the stars, waiting through the pain.",
    "Like the moon that longs for the sky,",
    "I miss you in every breath, in every sigh",
    "I still talk to the sky, hoping you might hear,",
    "That I’m still the one who holds you near",
    "If your heart still beats behind that wall,",
    "Know I never stopped loving you at all",
    "And if you ever turn around one quiet day,",
    "Where light peeks through your cloudy grey",
    "You'll find me there, with arms wide still,",
    "No questions asked, just heart and will",
    "I've learned to listen, to hold, to grow,",
    "To show your love in ways you’d know",
    "To laugh with you, or just be near,",
    "To wipe away each quiet fear",
    "And if we walk where flowers bloom,",
    "No matter how long the waiting room",
    "I’ll carry joy, not just the pain,",
    "For even storms must turn to rain",
    "If your heart still speaks my name,",
    "In quiet echoes or quiet flame",
    "Then don’t hold back, don’t fear the start,",
    "Come walk again into my heart",
    "No perfect script, no flawless page,",
    "Just truth and love at every stage",
    "Whatever broke, we’ll heal it slow,",
    "If it’s with you, I’ll never let go",
    "For if your soul still feels the thread,",
    "Know this love was never dead",
    "But now... the pen is yours to hold",
    "To write the story we never told"
